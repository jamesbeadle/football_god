  <h1 class="default-header">Our Vision</h1>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod was created to provide a much needed fixed-odds betting platform
    to the Internet Computer whilst utilising it's unique framework to manage
    risk through the power of tokenomics.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod will provide this facility using its deflationary utility token,
    $FOOTBALL. Betting platforms are very profitable, we aim to use the reality
    of more losing bets than winning bets to control the token supply. When a
    bet loses, the stake is burned, decreasing the circlulating supply. This is
    offset by more infrequent winning scenarios, minting winnings, allowing the
    DAO to always have the liquidity required to cover winning bets.
  </p>

  <p>
    FootballGod will bring all the functionality users of betting platforms are
    familiar with. This will include betting across different in game
    categories, like goalscorer and scoreline markets. Users will be able to
    build accumulators within specific game markets in addition to multiple
    games.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4 default-header">Why The Internet Computer?</p>
  <p>
    The Internet Computer (IC) is the only computer system in the world that
    allows users of an online service to truly own that service. The IC's unique
    architecture allows the interface the user engages with to be stored on the
    network, bypassing the big tech companies who do not have an interest in
    providing decentralised services. The IC not only has the capabilities to
    shift power structures in the tech world, it is built with its own
    decentralised service creation infrastructure that allow services like
    FootballGod to become Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs).
    FootballGod will enable gamblers to build a betting platform to suit them,
    allowing them to design the games and features they want to see but also
    define the control measures put in place to ensure gambling is done
    responsibly.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    The online sports betting market was valued at more than $50bn in 2023.
    FootballGod aims to provide a superior, decentralised service for football
    fans using it's utility token, $FOOTBALL. With all bets being placed with
    the $FOOTBALL token we are able to manage the token supply, aiming to keep
    it at the starting amount of 1 billion tokens. The DAO's treasury and
    overall value will increase as deposits are made within the platform's
    cashier.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We aim to phase in our betting services and mini games. We have applied for
    a gambling licence in the UK and will keep the community updated on the
    application's progress. We aim to provide reliable fixed-odds betting
    markets for every major football league in the world but also mini games for
    major events like international football tournaments.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We will phase in markets and features like building accumulators, building
    out a completely decentralised live odds manager built from algorithms
    managed by the FootballGod DAO.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Our vision for FootballGod encompasses a commitment to societal impact,
    specifically through our organisation, the ICPFA. The ICPFA will be focused
    on supporting grassroots football initiatives, demonstrating our belief in
    FootballGod's ability to bring about positive change in the football
    community using the IC.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mb-4">
    We aim for FootballGod to be the home of Football betting, providing the
    high quality application expected in today's modern betting landscape.
