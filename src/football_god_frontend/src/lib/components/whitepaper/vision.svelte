  <h1 class="default-header">Our Vision</h1>
  <p class="my-4">FootballGod was created to provide a much needed fixed-odds betting platform to the Internet Computer whilst utilising it's unique framework to manage risk through the power of tokenomics.</p>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod will provide this facility using its deflationary utility token, $FOOTBALL. Betting platforms are very profitable, we aim to use the reality of more losing bets than winning bets to control the token supply. 
    When a bet loses, the stake is burned, decreasing the circlulating supply. This is offset by more infrequent winning scenarios, minting winnings, allowing the DAO to always have the liquidity required to cover winning bets.
  </p>

  <p>FootballGod will bring all the functionality users of betting platforms are familiar with. 
    This will include betting across different in game categories, like goalscorer and scoreline markets. 
    Users will be able to build accumulators within specific game markets in addition to multiple games.</p>

  <p class="my-4 default-header">Why The Internet Computer?</p>
  <p>
    The Internet Computer (IC) is the only computer system in the world that
    allows users of an online service to truly own that service. The IC's unique
    architecture allows the interface the user engages with to be stored on the
    network, bypassing the big tech companies who do not have an interest in
    providing decentralised services. The IC not only has the capabilities to
    shift power structures in the tech world, it is built with its own
    decentralised service creation infrastructure that allow services like
    FootballGod to become Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). FootballGod will 
    enable gamblers to build a betting platform to suit them, allowing them to design the games 
    and features they want to see but also define the control measures put in place to ensure gambling
    is done responsibly.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    
    The online sports betting market was valued at more than $50bn in 2023. FootballGod aims to provide a 
    superior, decentralised service for football fans using it's utility token, $FOOTBALL. With all bets being placed 
    with the $FOOTBALL token we are able to manage the token supply, aiming to keep it at the starting amount of 1 billion tokens. 
    The DAO's treasury and overall value will increase as deposits are made within the platform's cashier.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We aim to phase in our betting services and mini games. During our Euro2024 sweepstake game, 
    match betting will be enabled throughout the tournament and into the start of the Premier League season.
    We aim to provide reliable fixed-odds betting markets for every major football league in the world but also mini games for major events like international football tournaments.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We will phase in markets and features like building accumulators, building out a completely decentralised live odds manager built from algorithms managed by the FootballGod DAO.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Our vision for FootballGod encompasses a commitment to societal impact,
    specifically through our organisation, the ICPFA. The ICPFA will be focused
    on supporting grassroots football initiatives, demonstrating our belief in
    FootballGod's ability to bring about positive change in the football community
    using the IC.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mb-4">
    We aim for FootballGod to be the home of Football betting, providing the high quality application expected in today's modern betting landscape.
