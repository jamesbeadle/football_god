  <h1 class="default-header">Our Vision</h1>
  <p class="my-4">FootballGod was created to provide a much needed fixed-odds betting platform to the Internet Computer whilst utilising it's unique framework to manage risk through the power of tokenomics.</p>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod will provide this facility using deflationary tokenomics, proving the viability of these tokenomics in it's Euro2024 beta.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 default-header">Why The Internet Computer?</p>
  <p>
    The Internet Computer (IC) is the only computer system in the world that
    allows users of an online service to truly own that service. The IC's unique
    architecture allows the interface the user engages with to be stored on the
    network, bypassing the big tech companies who do not have an interest in
    providing decentralised services. The IC not only has the capabilities to
    shift power structures in the tech world, it is built with its own
    decentralised service creation infrastructure that allow services like
    FootballGod to become Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). FootballGod will 
    enable gamblers to build a betting platform to suit them, allowing them to design the games 
    and features they want to see but also define the control measures put in place to ensure gambling
    is done responsibly.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    
    The online sports betting market was valued at more than $50bn in 2023. FootballGod aims to provide a 
    superior, decentralised service for football fans using it's utility token, $FOOTBALL. With all bets being placed 
    with the $FOOTBALL token we are able to manage the token supply, aiming to keep it at the starting amount of 1 billion tokens. 
    The DAO's treasury and overall value will increase as deposits are made within the platforms cashier.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We aim to phase in our betting services and mini games. During our Euro2024 sweepstake game, 
    match betting will be enabled throughout the tournament and into the start of the Premier League season.
    We aim to provide reliable fixed-odds betting markets for every major football league in the world but also mini games for major events like international football tournaments.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    We will phase in markets and features like building accumulators, building out a completely decentralised live odds manager built from algorithms managed by the FootballGod DAO.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    Our vision for FootballGod encompasses a commitment to societal impact,
    specifically through our organisation, the ICPFA. The ICPFA will be focused
    on supporting grassroots football initiatives, demonstrating our belief in
    FootballGod's ability to bring about positive change in the football community
    using the IC.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4 mb-4">
    We aim for FootballGod to be the home of Football betting, providing the high quality application expected in today's modern betting landscape.
