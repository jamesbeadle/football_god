  <h1 class="default-header">Our Vision</h1>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod has been created to provide a much needed fixed-odds betting
    platform to the Internet Computer. FootballGod will utilise the IC's unique
    framework to manage risk through the power of deflationary tokenomics.
    FootballGod will provide users with in game betting, the ability to build
    accumulators and unique mini games giving users the opportunity to engage
    with the platform on a regular basis.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod will provide this service using the DAO's deflationary utility
    token, $FOOTBALL. Betting platforms are very profitable, we aim to use the
    reality of more losing bets than winning bets to control the token supply.
    When a bet loses, the stake is burned, decreasing the circlulating supply.
    This is offset by more infrequent winning scenarios in which tokens are
    minted, allowing the DAO to always have the liquidity required to cover
    winning bets.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4 default-header">Why The Internet Computer?</p>
  <p>
    The Internet Computer (IC) is the only computer system in the world that
    allows users of an online service to truly own that service. The IC's unique
    architecture allows the interface the user engages with to be stored on the
    network, bypassing the big tech companies who do not have an interest in
    providing decentralised services. The IC not only has the capabilities to
    shift power structures in the tech world, it is built with its own
    decentralised service creation infrastructure that allow services like
    FootballGod to become Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs).
    FootballGod will enable gamblers to build a betting platform made for them,
    allowing them to design the games and features they want to see but also
    define the control measures put in place to ensure gambling is done
    responsibly.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4 default-header">The Future</p>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod functions entirely on-chain, aspiring to operate under the
    Internet Computer’s Service Nervous System. The DAO will govern the inner
    workings of the betting platform, using the tools available to control the
    deflationary tokenomic model in use by FootballGod. Token holders have the
    ability to control the rate of deflation by voting to increase or decrease
    the spread of odds offered on the platform.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4">
    We aim to phase in difference markets, mini games and features as the
    required jurisdicational gambling licenses are acquired. Eventually we want
    to provide reliable fixed-odds betting markets for every major football
    league in the world along with mini games for major events like
    international football tournaments.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4">
    Our vision for FootballGod encompasses a commitment to societal impact,
    specifically through our organisation, the ICPFA. The ICPFA will be focused
    on supporting grassroots football initiatives, demonstrating our belief in
    FootballGod's ability to bring about positive change in the football
    community using the IC.
