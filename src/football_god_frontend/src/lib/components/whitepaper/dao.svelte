  <h1 class="default-header">FootballGod DAO</h1>
  <p class="my-4">
    FootballGod functions entirely on-chain as a DAO, aspiring to operate under
    the Internet Computer’s Service Nervous System. The DAO governs the inner
    workings of the betting platform, using tools available to control the
    deflationary tokenomic model in use by FootballGod. Token holders have the
    ability to control the rate of deflation by voting to increase or decrease
    the spread of odds offered on the platform.

  <p class="my-2">
    To counter any shortage in $FOOTBALL tokens the FootballGod website will
    contain a treasury, where ICP can be swapped for newly minted $FOOTBALL
    tokens to bet with. This additional supply is countered by an increase in
    $ICP in the FootballGod treasury, have a minimal impact on the token price.
    The DAO can then manage the token supply by adjusting the odds spread.

    DAO voting rewards are applied at a reward rate of 1% per year.
