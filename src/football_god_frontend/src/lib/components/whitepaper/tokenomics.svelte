  <h1 class="default-header my-4">$FOOTBALL Utility Token</h1>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header">Utility and Functionality</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    All bets and entry fees for mini games will be paid in $FOOTBALL, giving the
    token direct utility.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">Genesis Token Allocation</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    At the outset, FootballGod's token allocation will be as follows:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>ICPFA: 12%</li>
    <li>Presale: 12%</li>
    <li>SNS Decentralisation Sale: 25%</li>
    <li>DAO Treasury: 51%</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="my-2">
    Each SNS decentralisation swap participant will receive their $FPL within 5
    baskets of equal neurons. The neurons will contain the following
    configuration:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>Basket 1: Unlocked with zero dissolve delay.</li>
    <li>Basket 2: Unlocked with a 3 month dissolve delay.</li>
    <li>Basket 3: Unlocked with a 6 month dissolve delay.</li>
    <li>Basket 4: Unlocked with a 9 month dissolve delay.</li>
    <li>Basket 5: Unlocked with a 12 month dissolve delay.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="my-2">
    The FootballGod presale will be used as a demonstration of the tokenomics in
    use within the DAO. For this purpose 12m $PRESALE tokens will be minted,
    with 6m available to purchase through the FootballGod Cashier. Bets will be
    placeable on certain markets throughout Euro2024, to demonstrate the nature
    of burning losing bets and minting winning bets. In the case of the presale
    beta tokens will not be minted, just assigned from the remaining 6m
    available, giving users a chance to win more of the presale through placing
    bets but equally lose their presale investment through betting.
  </p>

  <p class="my-2">
    The OpenFPL founder, James Beadle, will receive his neuron locked for 4
    years with a 2 year dissolve delay.

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">Mitigation against a 51% Attack</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    There is a danger that the OpenFPL SNS treasury could be the target of an
    attack. One possible scenario is for an attacker to buy a large proportion
    of the FPL tokens in the decentralisation sale and immediately increase the
    dissolve delay of all of their neurons to the maximum 4 year in an attempt
    to gain more than 50% of the SNS voting power. If successful they could
    force through a proposal to transfer the entire ICP and FPL treasury to
    themselves. The Community Fund actually provides a great deal of mitigation
    against this scenario because it limits the proportion of voting power an
    attacker would be able to acquire.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    The amount raised in the decentralisation will be used as follows:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>
      80% will be staked in an 8 year neuron with the maturity interest paid to
      the ICPFA.
    </li>
    <li>
      10% will be available for exchange liquidity to enable trading of the FPL
      token.
    </li>
    <li>
      5% will be paid directly to the ICPFA after the decentralisation sale.
    </li>
    <li>
      5% will be held in reserve for cycles to run OpenFPL, likely to be unused
      as OpenFPL begins generating revenue.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">Tokenomics</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    With a deflationary tokenomics model the DAO will require deposits from
    customers to mint more tokens. Increasing the asset value the tokens
    protect.
  </p>

  <h2 class="default-sub-header mt-4">ICPFA Overview</h2>
  <p class="my-2">
    The ICPFA oversees the development, marketing, and management of
    FootballGod. The aim is to build a platform that delivers the familiar
    fixed-odds betting experience people are used to. To ensure the platform
    gives back, 25% of the ICPFA's earned maturity interest will contribute to
    the ICPFA Community Fund, supporting grassroots football projects. Maturity
    interest will be claimed retrospectively after it has been earned by the
    ICPFA.
  </p>

  <p class="my-2">
    The ICPFA will receive 5% of the decentralisation sale along with the
    maturity interest from the staked neuron. These funds will be use for the
    following:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>
      The ongoing promotion and marketing of FootballGod both online and
      offline.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="my-2">Along with paying the founding team members:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>James Beadle - Founder, Lead Developer</li>
    <li>George Robinson - Community Manager</li>
  </ul>
